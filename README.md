The Block Chain Based Voting system is a project brought by CowChain, In this we used solidty to form a smart contract
 and hosted it using polygon testnet.Then we used React along with Java Script to connect the contract to frontend.
The working is as follows:

## Todo List📝

### **Staking Feature:**
- Implement staking functionality allowing users to lock up their tokens for a set period in exchange for rewards.
- Integrate staking into the voting system so that voters can stake their tokens before casting their votes.
- Calculate staking rewards based on the amount of tokens staked and the duration of the stake.
- Create a user-friendly interface for staking tokens with customizable durations and yield calculations.

### **User Interface Enhancements:**
- Improve user interface and user experience to ensure a clean, intuitive dashboard for users to manage their investments, monitor performance, and track staking rewards.
- Implement advanced voting options (e.g., weighted voting, ranked-choice voting).

### **Security Measures:**
- Implement robust security protocols to safeguard user funds and personal information (e.g., multi-sig wallets, reentrancy protection).

## **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
- Platform functionality and usability
- Token launch and staking capabilities
- Security and compliance with industry standards
- User adoption and engagement
